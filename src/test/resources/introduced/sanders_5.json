(Sec. 604) Directs the Secretary to establish an advisory board composed of individuals with experience in press, public relations, marketing, or communications at each VA health care system and each VISN that does not contain a health care system. Requires each advisory board to advise the Assistant Secretary for Public and Intergovernmental Affairs on: (1) effectively developing, implementing, and coordinating national and local outreach efforts; and (2) assisting the director of its health care system in conducting outreach activities the board considers appropriate. Terminates the advisory boards four years after this Act\u0027s enactment. (Sec. 605) Requires the VA to submit its report to Congress on outreach activities annually (currently, biennially). Title VII: Employment and Related Matters - Subtitle A: Employment Matters - (Sec. 701) Requires: (1) federal agencies to develop plans to exercise their authority under specified law to hire veterans during the five years beginning on this Act\u0027s enactment, and (2) the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to ensure that those plans result in the appointment of at least 15,000 veterans to existing vacancies. Excludes veterans hired by the VA or Department of Defense (DOD) from that number. (Sec. 702) Requires a state, as a condition for receipt of a grant or contract from the VA for support of disabled veterans\u0027 outreach specialists and local veterans\u0027 employment representatives, to establish a program that issues a license or credential to a veteran without requiring any training or apprenticeship if such veteran:   receives a satisfactory score on completion of an examination administered by that state,   has been awarded a military occupational specialty that is substantially equivalent to or exceeds the state\u0027s requirements for the issuance of such license or credential,   has engaged in the active practice of the occupation for which the veteran is seeking such license or credential for at least two of the preceding five years, and   pays any fees the state requires for such license or credential.  Allows the Secretary of Labor to waive such requirement for certain states that take into account a veteran\u0027s performance on an examination and previous military training when determining whether the veteran needs further training for a license or credential. (Sec. 703) Requires the Secretary of Labor to: (1) compile a list of Internet websites and applications that can assist veterans in seeking employment; (2) place a particular priority on identifying websites and applications that match veterans with available jobs requiring their skills and that permit employers to post information about available jobs; and (3) report to the Veterans\u0027 Affairs Committees on the feasibility and advisability of creating a single, unified Internet-based employment portal for veterans to use when seeking federal employment. (Sec. 704) Directs the Secretary of Labor to include information about disability-related employment and education protections in the Transition Assistance Program, which provides employment and job training assistance and related services for service members being separated from active duty and for their spouses. Subtitle B: Small Business Matters - (Sec. 711) Expands the VA\u0027s contracting goals and preferences to include conditional ownership of small business concerns that are fully owned by one or more veterans. (Sec. 712) Permits the surviving spouse of a veteran owner of a small business to maintain the status of the small business as one owned or controlled by a veteran for up to: (1) 10 years after the veteran\u0027s death if such veteran was either 100% disabled or died from a service-connected disability; or (2) 3 years after such death, if the veteran was less than 100% disabled and did not die from a service-connected disability. (That status ends if the surviving spouse remarries or sells the small business before those periods are over.) (Sec. 713) Permits the surviving spouse or dependent child of a service member who owns at least 51% of a small business and dies in the line of duty to maintain the status of such small business as one owned or controlled by a veteran for up to 10 years following the death of such service member. (That status ends before the end of such period if the surviving spouse remarries or the surviving spouse or dependent child sells an ownership interest in the small business and no longer owns at least 51% of it.) (Sec. 714) Requires the Secretary, upon determining, for purposes of VA small business contracting goals, that an individual would have had a greater degree of ownership of a small business in a state other than a community property state, to treat such small business as licensed in a non-community property state. Title VIII: Other Matters - (Sec. 801) Requires the Secretary, if a veteran eligible for a pension for service or for a non-service-connected disability or the spouse of such veteran disposes of a resource that was part of such veteran\u0027s estate for less than its fair market value within three years before applying for such pension, to deny or discontinue the pension payment for months beginning on the date of such disposition and ending when the uncompensated value of such resource is reached. Provides the same denial or discontinuance in the case of a veteran eligible for an increased pension payment on account of a child, unless the Secretary determines that such denial or discontinuance would work an undue hardship. Applies the same denial or discontinuance, with the same exception, in the case of: (1) a veteran\u0027s surviving spouse who disposes of a covered resource for less than fair market value within such period, and (2) an increased pension for such spouse on account of a child. Requires the Secretary, at the time a veteran, surviving spouse, or child applies for such a pension, to: (1) inform the individual of such requirements, and (2) obtain information to determine whether a period of ineligibility for such payments will be required. (Sec. 802) Reauthorizes appropriations through FY 2018 for the VA\u0027s Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events. Allows funding that is not used to provide monthly subsistence allowances to veterans training to be Paralympic athletes to be used for other Office activities. Permits (currently, requires) the Office to cooperate with the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) and its partners to promote the participation of disabled veterans and disabled military personnel in sporting events sponsored by such entities. (Sec. 803) Authorizes the Secretary to: (1) plan, develop, manage, and implement an integrated adaptive sports program for disabled veterans and disabled military personnel; or (2) award grants to the USOC to do so. Requires the USOC\u0027s grant application to include information on: (1) anticipated personnel, travel, and administrative costs to be paid for by the USOC or its subgrantees; (2) its financial controls; and (3) its performance metrics. Reauthorizes appropriations for such program through FY2015. Authorizes the VA to use funds from such program for activities of the Office of National Veterans Sports Programs and Special Events. Directs the GAO to report to Congress, within two years after this Act\u0027s enactment, on the use of any grants made to the USOC under such program. (Sec. 804) Eliminates a provision establishing an effective date for the award or increase of a surviving spouse\u0027s benefits on account of a child whose marriage is terminated by death or divorce. (Sec. 805) Extends from 6 months to 18 months after the separation or discharge from active service the deadline by which the Secretary must schedule a medical examination for a veteran in receipt of a temporary disability rating for a severe mental disorder. (Sec. 806) Authorizes the Secretary to issue veteran identification cards and work with national retail chains to ensure that they recognize those cards when offering veterans reduced prices on pharmaceuticals, consumer products, and services. (Sec. 807) Honors as a veteran any person who is entitled to retired pay for nonregular (reserve) service or who would be so entitled but for age. Provides that such person shall not be entitled to any benefit by reason of such recognition. (Sec. 808) Extends the Secretary\u0027s authority to collect housing loan guarantee fees. (Sec. 809) Directs the Secretary to review the process for determining whether Filipinos who claim to have served in support of the U.S. Armed Forces in World War II meet the service requirements for payments from the Filipino Veterans Equity Compensation Fund. (Sec. 810) Requires the Secretary to report to the Veterans\u0027 Affairs Committees on: (1) the extent to which Laotian military forces provided combat support to the U.S. Armed Forces between February 28, 1961, and May 15, 1975, (2) whether the current classification by the DOD Civilian/Military Service Review Board of service by Hmong ethnicity is appropriate, and (3) any recommendations for legislative action. (Sec. 811) Requires the Secretary of Labor to report to Congress on the assistance available to veterans to obtain the training needed to purchase and operate a franchise. (Sec. 812) Limits the aggregate amount of awards and bonuses payable to VA employees during FY 2014. ",

Makes eligible for such program an individual who:   is a veteran who was discharged or released from service under conditions other than dishonorable,  is a member of the reserves who served on active duty for more than 180 consecutive days during the two-year period ending on the date of participation in the program,  is between the ages of 18 and 34 or 55 and 64,  is not in receiving compensation through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) due to unemployability,  is not enrolled in a federal or state job training program, and  is considered by the Secretary to be unemployed or underemployed.  Outlines employer eligibility requirements, and prohibits an employer from displacing current employees with program participants. Limits the program to 50,000 participants, and directs the Secretary to carry out the program in areas with high concentrations of veterans. Provides subsidy amounts as percentages of basic pay for the work performed. Limits payment duration to one year or the period of employment under the program. Expresses the sense of Congress that such subsidy should not be paid for the performance of functions that are so inherently governmental that the position would not provide the individual with the experience, training, or skills necessary for employment in the private sector. Requires pilot program reports during its duration. Directs the VA Secretary to conduct a three-year pilot program to assess the feasibility and advisability of establishing a program of career transition services to assist eligible individuals in obtaining work experience in the private sector, increasing their marketable skills, obtaining long-term employment, and integrating into their local communities.
